# Data Science Projects

## [Classifying Pneumonia](./Pneumonia/Pneumonia.html)

Using a Fully Convolutional Network, we can predict the presence of pneumonia from chest x-rays

## [National Supported Work Program](./SOO/Matching.html)

We salvage an observational sample to reproduce the NSW Demonstration experiment. 
Using causal inference, we can isolate the effect of the NSW program on participants' income.

## [Sensitivity and the FARC deal](./Sensitivity/Sensitivity.html)

How well does a model hold up when incorporating unknown information? 
We derive some helpful ways to think about regression sensitivity and attempt to reproduce the findings of a recent paper on the FARC peace agreement.
